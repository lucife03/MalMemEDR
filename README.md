# Malware Detection using Memory Forensics and Deep Learning

## Project Overview
This project aims to detect malicious software using memory forensics combined with deep learning techniques. By analyzing memory dump data, the system identifies and classifies malware using a custom-built deep neural network (DNN). The focus is on real-time detection of advanced threats, including obfuscated and polymorphic malware.

## Objectives
- Develop a memory forensics-based malware detection system using deep learning.
- Enhance detection accuracy for obfuscated and fileless malware.
- Provide real-time threat detection capabilities.
- Evaluate model performance using standard metrics.

## Approach
1. **Memory Forensics:** Perform memory dump analysis to capture traces of malicious activity.
2. **Feature Engineering:** Apply variance thresholding and feature importance ranking using XGBoost.
3. **Dimensionality Reduction:** Reduce feature dimensions to optimize computational efficiency.
4. **Model Design:** Implement a deep neural network with a feature extractor and classifier using:
    - Fully connected layers
    - ReLU activation
    - Batch normalization
    - Dropout regularization
5. **Classification:** Perform binary classification using softmax activation to distinguish benign from malicious activity.
6. **Evaluation:** Assess the model's accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

## Dataset
- **Source:** The dataset consists of 58,596 memory dump samples.
- **Categories:** Balanced dataset containing both benign and malicious samples.
- **Preprocessing:** Applied feature extraction and selection for dimensionality reduction.

## Implementation Environment
- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Libraries:** TensorFlow, Keras, NumPy, Pandas, XGBoost
- **Development Tools:** Jupyter Notebook, Google Colab
- **Operating System:** Ubuntu 20.04

## Results
- Achieved 99.80% accuracy in malware detection.
- Perfect precision, recall, and F1-score metrics.
- Efficient detection of unknown and zero-day malware.

## Future Scope
- Expand to multi-class classification for identifying specific malware families.
- Enhance the detection of zero-day threats.
- Integrate with real-world cybersecurity frameworks.
